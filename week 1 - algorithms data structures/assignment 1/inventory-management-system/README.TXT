PROJECT TITLE: ASSIGNMENT 1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.
Steps:
1.	Understand the Problem:
o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a new project for the inventory management system.
3.	Implementation:
o	Define a class Product with attributes like productId, productName, quantity, and price.
o	Choose an appropriate data structure to store the products (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
o	Implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory.
4.	Analysis:
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
o	Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
